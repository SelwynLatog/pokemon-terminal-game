# Pokémon Emerald (Terminal Version)

A large terminal-based game inspired by Pokémon Emerald, built entirely using ASCII graphics and text-based interfaces.

This project recreates core Pokémon gameplay in the terminal, including exploration, NPC interactions, story progression, and a complete Gen 3-style battle system. It was developed as a long-term learning project and also serves as my final project for our Data Structures and Algorithms class.

## Features
- Cursor-driven menus and text-based UI
- Full turn-based battle engine
  - Type effectiveness and STAB
  - Critical hits and accuracy checks
  - Damage multipliers
- ASCII battle frames and animations
- Over 80 ASCII map layouts based on Pokémon Emerald locations
- NPCs and trainer battles inspired by the original game
- Story states and progression
- Mini ASCII cutscene animations
- Gen 3 Pokédex-style entries and Gen 3 moves

## Project Scope
This project is approximately 15,000+ lines of code and was developed incrementally while learning and experimenting with different systems. The focus was on functionality, game logic, and recreating the gameplay feel rather than perfect code structure.

## Concepts Practiced
- Large-scale program organization
- State management (menus, exploration, battles, story)
- Game logic and rule systems
- Randomization and probability
- ASCII-based UI design
- Debugging and iteration over a long-term project

## How to Run
1. Download all files and compile the program
2. Run the .cpp file on terminal
3. Follow the on-screen menus and prompts

## Status
Ongoing project. Code quality, structure, and features will continue to improve as I learn more.
